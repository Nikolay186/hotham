# How to contribute to Hotham
First of all, thank you so much for your interest and support in Hotham. As a small, open source project, our success is only possible because of people like **you**.

## Filing bugs üêõ
Bug reports are some of the most helpful things you can add. Did the example project fail to run on your headset? Did the engine crash when trying to run your game? Did the model importer panic when importing a model? Please, file and issue and **let us know**!

## General questions üí¨
The best place to get a quick question answered is in [the Hotham discord](https://discord.gg/SZEZUX6ZsQ). There you can speak with the Hotham core team, as well as other developers who are also working on their own projects with Hotham.

## Contributing code üî®
Fixed a bug? Got a suggestion for a great feature? Open a pull request! While we strive to keep the scope of the project small (making VR applications for mobile headsets), we're also open to new ideas. if you're thinking of contributing a large feature, it might be a good idea to get in touch first to see if that would be a good fit for the future roadmap, or whether it's something that's planned for later on.

## Sponsoring üí∞
If you're light on time, why not [contribute some of your hard earned cash money for the project](https://github.com/sponsors/leetvr)? Your funds help enable more developers to work full time on the project.
